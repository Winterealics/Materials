In the following example of a routine in Python, line 2 and line 3 are the blocks of statements and the identifier is `hello`.\n","\n","```python\n","1 def hello():\n","2    x = input('Please enter your name:')\n","3    print('Hello {}. Nice to meet you.'.format(x))\n","```\n","\n","It is good programming practice to group statements into routines, such that each routine will do just one task. As routines are declared separately from the main program body. This means the main program body is much easier to understand as it gives an overview of the tasks that make up the solution. The main program body should reflect your problem-solving steps.\n","\n","By utilising routines, programmers write modular code and ensure that there is maximal code reuse. Modularity and code reuse are desirable because:\n","\n","- Serves the concept of decomposition, which allows use to address a more manageable sub-problem (instead of a larger more complex problem).\n","- It becomes easier to debug programs as each routine can be tested separately - i.e., testing and optimisation of the code is made easier\n","- Time is not wasted re-writing code that has already been written.\n","- Having a common point of maintenance, which means that when any code requires adjustment or change, it only has to be modified at 1 point.\n","\n","It should be noted that programmers are expected to write code that is easy to maintain. The code may be maintained by someone other than the original programmer. Very large applications are written by teams of programmers and each programmer’s code needs to be easily understandable to the other programmers.\n","\n","\n","## 4.1 Functions and Procedures\n","\n","A routine may either correspond to a function or a procedure. A procedure corresponds to a sequence of steps that is given an identifier and can be called to perform a sub-task; procedures do not return any values to the code that called it.\n","\n","A function corresponds to a sequence of steps that is given an identifier and returns a single value; a function call must be part of an expression (since it returns a value).\n","\n","### 4.1.1 Why use function?\n","\n","* Functions help break program into smaller and modular chunks.\n","* It supports code reusability and reduces repeative code.\n","* It make large program more organized and manageable.\n","\n","### 4.1.2 Declaring and Calling a Function or Procedure\n","\n","In order to define a procedure or function, we must first declare it. A routine declaration consists of a routine interface (i.e., routine header) followed by a routine body. The routine body is the statement block.\n","\n","The following is an example in pseudocode.\n","\n",">```text\n",">1 FUNCTION square(n : INTEGER) : INTEGER\n",">2    DECLARE result : INTEGER\n",">3    result ← n * n\n",">4    RETURN result\n",">5 ENDFUNCTION\n",">```\n","\n","From the above example, we notice that the routine interface (or more specifically, the function interface since the above example is corresponds to a function) includes:\n","\n","- The identifier or name of the function (i.e., `square`)\n","- The parameter(s) (i.e., input variable(s)) for the function (i.e., the single input variable `n : INTEGER`)\n","- The data type of the `result` to be returned (i.e., the last `INTEGER` on the first line)\n","\n","Correspondingly, the function body contains:\n","\n","- The various statements that define what the function does (i.e., each line after the function header/interface)\n","- A statement that gives the function a value to return (i.e., the `return result` statement on the last line)\n","\n","Essentially, when we define a routine that requires values to be passed to the routine body, we use an ordered list of variables, termed **parameters**, in the routine interface. E.g., `n` is a parameter in the example above.\n","When the routine is called with an actual input, the input is called an **argument**, i.e., the arguments supplied are assigned to the corresponding parameter of the routine. Do note the order of the parameters in the parameter list must be the same as the order in the list of arguments. Using our example above, in the expression `square(2)`, `2` is the argument.\n","\n","When an executed program gets to the statement that includes a function call as part of the expression, the function is executed. The value returned from this function call is then used in the expression. Thus, with the above line of code, the result of the `square(2)` function call is assigned to the variable `result`.\n","\n","Do remember that only functions have return values. Thus, when a procedure is called, it does not form part of an expression.\n","\n","When a routine does not include any parameters, we simply specify an empty set of parentheses `()` instead. The following is an example.\n","\n","```text\n","1 FUNCTION get_integer(): INTEGER\n","2    INPUT “Input an integer value:” value\n","3    RETURN value\n","4 ENDFUNCTION\n","```\n","\n","The above function may be called using:\n","\n","```text\n","int_input ← get_integer()\n","```\n","\n","Notice that in both the function interface and the call to the function, only `()` is specified.\n","\n","When a routine requires one or more values from the main program, these are supplied as **arguments** to the subroutine at the time it is called.\n","\n","#### Exercise 4.1\n","\n","Name 3 functions in Python that we have encountered so far."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"UVrE7LGwp3mL"},"outputs":[],"source":["#Exercise 4.1\n","\n","#print()\n","#abs()\n","#max()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3ZCDFwkip3mM"},"source":["#### 4.1.3 Defining Functions in Python\n","\n","In Python, we declare a function with the following syntax:\n","\n","```python\n","def function_name(parameters):\n","\t\"\"\"docstring\"\"\"\n","\tstatement(s)\n","```\n","\n","* Keyword `def` marks the start of a function.\n","* Every function has an user defined name as unique identifier.

However, as explained previously, each time a routine is called, it invokes a new stack. Thus, because of the stack overheads, recursive algorithms may not be as efficient as iterative solutions. In contrast, an iterative solution typically only utilises a single stack. Additionally, if many recursive calls are made, stack space could run out.

Each time a recursive function is called, a new stack frame, containing function's local variables, parameters, and the return address (the point to return to after the function finishes execution), is created.\n","2. The newly created stack frame is pushed onto the call stack. This means that the execution context of the current function call is saved at the top of the stack. The stack grows with each recursive call.\n","3. The execution of the current function is suspended. The new function call is executed with its own stack frame at the top of the stack.\n","4. When a base case is reached or the function completes its task, the function returns a value. The current stack frame is then popped from the stack, and the execution resumes from the return address saved in the stack frame of the previous function call. This process continues until all recursive calls are resolved and the stack is empty again.\n","\n","Recursion in Python\n","* Python stops the function calls after a depth of 1000 calls, and throws a `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exeeded..` error.\n","* You can increase recursion depth using `sys.setrecursionlimit(limit)` function.\n","\n",">```python\n",">import sys\n",">\n",">sys.setrecursionlimit(1050)\n",">fib(1050)\n",">```"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3.9.1 64-bit","metadata":{"interpreter":{"hash":"dcacb0086e9a4f4eabd41c33bf4faac5ea0a3337ed3f5eff0680afa930572c04"}},"name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.1-final"},"orig_nbformat":2,"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"https://github.com/njc-cz2-2021/Materials/blob/main/Notes/Chapter_04_Functions.ipynb","timestamp":1741737659166}]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
